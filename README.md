## Goal of analysis
The goal of this analysis is to investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 infection rates at the county level in the United States. Specifically, we aim to understand how two key socioeconomic factors, "Median Household Income" and the "Percentage of Vaccinated Population," may be associated with the "COVID-19 Infection Rate."
## Measurment
The measurement for this analysis is the "COVID-19 Infection Rate." This rate is defined as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in each county. It serves as an indicator of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases within a county, standardized to the population size.
## Two factors
1)Median household income
This factor represents the median household income in each county, measured in dollars ($). It is a proxy for the economic status or prosperity of the county. Higher median incomes typically suggest greater economic well-being.
2)Percentage of Population vaccinated
This factor indicates the percentage of the population in each county that has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. It reflects the level of vaccination coverage within a county, which can impact the spread and severity of COVID-19.
## Data collected
I have collected sample data for counties, including their COVID-19 Infection Rates, Median Household Incomes, and Percentages of Vaccinated Population from Census.gov and In class provided github data.
